# Prompt user for a level, n
# If the user does not input '1,2, or 3, the program should prompt again
# Randomly generate ten(10) math problems formatted as 'X + Y = '
    # wherein X and Y is a non-negative integer with 'n' digits
    # No need to support operations other than addition (+).
# Prompt user to solve each of those problems
# If answer is not correct (or not even numbers), program should output 'EEE'
    # And prompt user again
    # allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem
# If user still does not answer correctly after three tries
    # the program should output the correct answer.
# The program should ultimately output the user's score: 
    # The number of correct answers out of 10
#Structure program as follows
    # get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a level and returns 1,2, or 3
    # generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer
        # with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1,2, or 3
